### 🎯 NEXT UP: Phase 1A - Authentication Design & Planning
**Ready to Start**: User model schema, JWT strategy, API endpoints specification
**Technical Stack Validated**: All foundational tools working, architecture decisions made
**Approach Confirmed**: Agile feature-first development methodology

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made

### Solo Developer Optimizations
- **Simplified Packages**: No individual package.json files for internal packages
- **Root Dependency Management**: Shared dependencies via PNPM workspace
- **Path Mapping**: TypeScript path resolution instead of complex project references
- **Agile Development**: Build complete features end-to-end before moving to next

### 2025 Technology Choices Finalized
- **Node.js 22.18.0+**: Latest LTS with native ESM optimizations and experimental TypeScript support
- **Express 5**: Modern async/await with automatic error handling (cutting-edge choice)
- **React 19**: Latest stable version with concurrent features and modern patterns
- **TypeScript 5.9**: Latest with deferred imports, stable node resolution, and strict type checking
- **PNPM 10**: Optimal monorepo performance and dependency management
- **ESLint 9**: Flat configuration format with comprehensive type checking rules
- **Vitest 3**: Modern test runner with native ESM support (faster than Jest)
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Latest utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite 7**: Next-generation frontend build tool

### Modern Development Philosophy
**Always Latest Stable**: This project deliberately chooses the newest stable versions of all technologies to ensure:
- **Future-Proof Skills**: Learning what will be industry standard, not what was
- **Modern Patterns**: ESM everywhere, async/await native, strict TypeScript
- **Professional Grade**: Enterprise-level architecture and best practices from day one
- **Interview Advantage**: Knowledge of cutting-edge tools that differentiate from other candidates

**Quality Standards**: No legacy compromises, no tutorial shortcuts - building production-ready software that demonstrates real professional capabilities.
