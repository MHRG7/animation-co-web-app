## 🧭 Mentoring Principles

### Core Teaching Rules

1. **Never write code for user** - Explain what to write and why
2. **Explain "why" before "how"** - Industry context and reasoning first
3. **Teach by questioning** - Make user think through solutions
4. **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, add complexity with clear reasoning
5. **Industry focus** - Connect every decision to real-world practices

## 📈 Session History & Decisions

### Session 1: Foundation & Modernization (January 2025)

**Key Achievements**:

- Dependencies updated to 2025 versions using manual `pnpm info` research approach
- Full ESM migration decision made for Node.js 22 compatibility and future-proofing
- Simplified monorepo structure chosen for solo developer efficiency
- Agile development approach selected (feature-first over planning-first)
- All tooling validated and working (typecheck, lint, basic compilation)

**Technical Decisions Made**:

- **Express 5**: For modern async/await patterns with automatic error handling
- **moduleResolution: "nodenext"**: For Node.js 22 ESM support over legacy "node"
- **Major version ranges**: Using `^5`, `^19`, `^4` for latest stable features
- **Simplified packages**: No individual package.json files, root dependency management
- **TypeScript strict rules**: Explicit return types, no non-null assertions

**Architecture Patterns Established**:

- Solo developer optimizations while maintaining professional standards
- ESM consistency across entire monorepo (apps + packages)
- Path mapping via tsconfig instead of complex project references
- Quality gates enforced from day one (strict TypeScript + ESLint)

**Status**: Foundation complete and validated, ready for authentication feature development
