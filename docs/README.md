# Documentation

This directory contains project documentation for developers, stakeholders, and future maintainers.

## Structure

- **roadmap.md**: Development phases and learning objectives (already created)
- **architecture.md**: System architecture decisions and patterns (to be created)
- **api.md**: API documentation and examples (to be created)
- **deployment.md**: Deployment procedures and environment setup (to be created)
- **contributing.md**: Guidelines for contributors (to be created)

## Living Documentation

This documentation is intended to evolve with the project. Each major feature or architectural decision should be documented here with the reasoning behind the choices made.

## For New Developers

Start with the roadmap.md to understand the project phases, then review the architecture.md to understand the system design before diving into the code.
